# Come to the dark side

This is a demo repo to accompany my lightning talk about theming.

It demonstrates how to use css-variables to

- Create different color themes (i.e. light mode and dark mode)
- Add other kinds of a11y customisations (i.e disabling animations)

## Get started

To get started, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view the demo app.
